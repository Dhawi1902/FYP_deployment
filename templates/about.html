        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p>This research addresses the scarcity of large and diverse dental datasets by using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Auto-Encoders to generate synthetic images. The study preprocesses a dataset of images labeled as caries, white spot lesion, and gingivitis, resizing, normalizing, and encoding them for consistency. The dataset is split into 80% for training and 20% for testing. An Auto-Encoder extracts features from the images, which are then used by a GAN to create synthetic images, enhancing the training set's diversity. A ResNet50 model is trained on this augmented dataset, achieving improved classification accuracy. The results show that combining Auto-Encoders with GANs effectively addresses data scarcity, enhancing dental image classification and diagnostic practices.</p>

            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p>The field of dental healthcare diagnostics heavily relies on the analysis of intraoral images to identify conditions such as caries, white spot lesions, and gingivitis. However, the development of accurate and reliable image classification models is significantly hindered by the scarcity of large, diverse, and well-annotated dental image datasets. Traditional data augmentation techniques often fall short in addressing the complexity and variability inherent in dental images, leading to suboptimal model performance. This scarcity not only limits the training potential of machine learning models but also impedes the advancement of automated diagnostic tools in dental healthcare. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>To address these challenges, this research proposes the integration of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with Auto-Encoders to generate high-quality synthetic dental images. By leveraging the features extracted by Auto-Encoders, the GANs can create realistic synthetic images that enhance the diversity and volume of the training dataset. This augmented dataset can then be used to train more robust image classification models, such as ResNet50, improving their accuracy and reliability. The primary problem this research aims to solve is the lack of sufficient and diverse dental image data, which is crucial for the development of effective diagnostic models in dental healthcare. </p>
